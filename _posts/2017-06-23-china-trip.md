※ 中国では英語縛りをしていたので英語で書くやつをする。


I'm at China, ChengDo(成都).
I come to China to follow laboratory parters.
My teacher is Chinese, So I appreciate him.
Date is between 6/23(Thu) to 6/26(Mon).

## Day 1, 6/23(Thu)

I ride the plane, this date.
I went to Chengdo(成都) via Shanghai(上海) from Haneda(羽田).

Ride time is long, and the plane's evironment is not good.
It's noisy by plane engine, and population density is high(cuz economy class).
So  I was tired and sleepy in ride time.

In addition, The plane which went to Chendo from Shanghai is LATE.
So I was confused, and I was unlucky.

So, I get up AM 6:00(JP), and my sleeping time in China Hotel is 2:30(CH).

## Day 2, 6/23(Thu)

I get up at 9:00. I had a breakfast in hotel.
This breakfast type is buffet(ビュッフェ).
My favorite food is sum of porridge and SPICY vegetable in the breakfast foods.

At next, I had Hot pot(火鍋) with my teacher.
Hot pot looks Fire. I had fire.

After I get hotel, My body is burnnig🔥🔥🔥.
