<!--readmore-->

Maybe, I'm checking my ethics through live streming.
So ethics of my favorite streamers is right for me.
For example, When streamer is smile, I check that
"if I were him, What do I feel..?".
In most cases, I get smile in this case,
because to watch live streaming is work that confirm my personality.
umm..  I should define my respecting person.
