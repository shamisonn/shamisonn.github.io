I keep in mind to write post in this blog.
And if theme is trash(like a poem),
I write in English until getting bored of that.

# Too difficult typing without being tired

When I practiced nvim by Tutor, I react this.
vim forced me to type keys on home position
(I feel that's a good point!).
When I type in home position,
my shoulder gets tired ;(
(Maybe because I'm not used to home position.)

This problem made by keyboard.
So I can solve this problem that
buy seperated keyboard.
ErgoDox? or?

I should research about that.
